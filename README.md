## Senior Full Stack Dev Test

If you can do it, send us the answer in a .zip file with all the instructions to run the code.
This is a simple test and we would like to see how you can do it more creative with a setup (e.g using HTML and CSS, maybe some Unit testing)
Good luck! (we want to take the final decision this week)

`1. Create a function that multiplies two numbers without using the multiply operator`

`2. Get the largest number of an array but iterating the array only once`

`3. Iterating an array just once write a function that removes undefined, null, 0 and false`

`4. Write a function that counts the number of times a word is repeated`

`5. Create a function that checks if the entered word is a palindrome`

`6. Create a function that receives a number and returns a list with all the numbers starting from 0 and ending in the entered number, when it finds a multiple of 3 it returns fizz and when it is a multiple of 5 it should return buzz, if it is a multiple of 3 and 5 must return fizz buzz`

## How to run the project?
Just double click index.html and there you can see every button of each problems

## Unit test is implemented?
Yes, it used Jasmine and it checks every case
